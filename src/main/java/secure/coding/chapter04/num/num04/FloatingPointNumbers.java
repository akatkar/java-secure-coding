/**
 * @rule: NUM04-J. D o not use floating-point numbers if precise computation is
 *        required
 *
 * @description: The Java language provides two primitive floating-point types,
 *               float and double, which are associated with the
 *               single-precision 32-bit and double-precision 64-bit format
 *               values and operations specified by IEEE 754 [ IEEE 754 ]. Each
 *               of the floating-point types has a fixed, limited number of
 *               mantissa bits. Consequently, it is impossible to precisely
 *               represent any ptg7041395 irrational number (for example, Ï€).
 *               Further, because these types use a binary mantissa, they cannot
 *               precisely represent many finite decimal numbers, such as 0.1,
 *               because these numbers have repeating binary representations.
